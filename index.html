                The theme was 'It's not a bug, it's a feature!', and my 'bug' was the player character not having their movement restricted when talking to NPCs. This, for example, lets them walk over textboxes, grab keys out of them, and start multiple conversations at once. It was awarded the prize for 'Most Innovative Game' out of around 30 teams of 1-6 people.

            <h2>Carpetman Listener</h2>
            <p>
                Building off of Caption Quest, this is a longer puzzle game following the same concept, made in PyGame and submitted to the Mental Health Game Dev Champions 2024 Jam on itch.io.
            </p>
            <div class="project-images">

            </div>
            <p>
                I designed 24 levels with some new features, such as textboxes with non-walkable borders, beam-activated switches, and eventually the ability to talk yourself. Many levels focus on playing around with the core mechanics in different ways.
            </p>
            <div class="project-images">
                <img src="cm3.png" alt="Carpetman Listener Screenshot">

            </div>
            <p>
                I am overall happy with the game, but feel it has lost a lot of charm compared to Caption Quest, despite me having far longer to work
                on it. The focus on pushing core concepts to their limits makes for some quite confusing yet similar puzzles, and I feel it would have
                been more engaging to have simpler puzzles but with new, interesting mechanics quickly introduced, which the original game did well.
                Regardless, this was a good lesson in level design and had MUCH cleaner code than Caption Quest.
