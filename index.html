            <h2>Caption Quest</h2>
            <p>
                A short top-down puzzle game made in 24 hours as a solo dev using PyGame for the University of Bristol 2022 GameJam.

                The theme was 'It's not a bug, it's a feature!', and my 'bug' was the player character not having their movement restricted when talking to NPCs. This, for example, lets them walk over textboxes, grab keys out of them, and start multiple conversations at once. It was awarded the prize for 'Most Innovative Game' out of around 30 teams of 1-6 people.

            <h2>Carpetman Listener</h2>
            <p>
                Building off of Caption Quest, this is a longer puzzle game following the same concept, made in PyGame and submitted to the Mental Health Game Dev Champions 2024 Jam on itch.io.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                I designed 24 levels with some new features, such as textboxes with non-walkable borders, beam-activated switches, and eventually the ability to talk yourself. Many levels focus on playing around with the core mechanics in different ways.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                I am overall happy with the game, but feel it has lost a lot of charm compared to Caption Quest, despite me having far longer to work
                on it. The focus on pushing core concepts to their limits makes for some quite confusing yet similar puzzles, and I feel it would have
                been more engaging to have simpler puzzles but with new, interesting mechanics quickly introduced, which the original game did well.
                Regardless, this was a good lesson in level design and had MUCH cleaner code than Caption Quest.

            <h2>AutoRhythm</h2>
            <p>
                Made for my dissertation, AutoRhythm is a simple note-playing rhythm game in the style of DDR or Guitar Hero, in which the user can supply any song and have a level generated for it which they can then play.
            </p>
            <div class="project-images">
                <img src="ar2.png" alt="AUTORHYTHM Screenshot">
                <img src="ar4.png" alt="AUTORHYTHM Screenshot">
            </div>
            <p>
                The game itself was made in Unity, with accompanying Python code to deal with level generation. The user supplies an MP3 to the relevant folder, and a level can be generated, played, and saved for future use.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Options to control level generation (difficulty, style, etc.)</li>
                <li>Easy rebinding with support for most HIDs and MIDI instruments</li>
                <li>Customizable number of note streams (1-6 input buttons)</li>
                <li>Level editor to tweak scores as needed</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>
                This project honestly worked better than expected, and can lead to some reasonably good levels for songs not featured in any rhythm games. It does not look very nice, but was intended to be more of a tool than an actual, polished rhythm game in it's own right.
            Endless options for improvements, but still a fun prototype.
